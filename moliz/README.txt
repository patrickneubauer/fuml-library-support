The moliz project is concerned with the execution of models based on the OMG standard fUML.

In model-driven development models are considered as the key artifacts and, as a result, the success of the whole development process relies on these models and their quality. Consequently, there is an urgent need for adequate methods to ensure high quality of models. Model execution can serve as the crucial basis for such methods by enabling to automatically test and debug models. Therefore, lessons learned from testing and debugging of code may serve as a valuable source of inspiration. However, the peculiarities of models in comparison to code, such as multiple views and different abstraction levels, impede the direct adoption of existing methods for models. Thus, we claim that the currently available tool support for model testing and debugging is still insufficient because these peculiarities are not adequately addressed. In this project, we aim at tackling these shortcomings by proposing a novel model execution environment based on fUML, which enables to efficiently test and debug models.

In short, the moliz project in concerned with

1.  model execution,
2.  model testing, and
3.  model debugging 

based on fUML under the consideration of the peculiarities of models like different abstraction levels, and incompleteness of models, semantic variations, and multiple views.

Moliz is realized by the Business Informatics Group, a research group of the Institute of Software Technology and Interactive Systems at the Vienna University of Technology. LieberLieber Software GmbH is a partner of this project.
